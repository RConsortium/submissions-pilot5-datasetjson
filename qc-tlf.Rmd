[1] "1. Title formatting: First image has 'Safety population' while second image has 'Safety population' - both identical. 2. Y-axis scale: Both images have identical scales from 0.0 to 1.0. 3. X-axis scale: Both images show 0 to 200 days. 4. Curve patterns: The three survival curves (Placebo in red/pink, Xanomeline Low Dose in green, Xanomeline High Dose in blue) follow nearly identical patterns in both images. 5. Risk table values: The 'At Risk' tables at the bottom show identical numerical values for all three treatment groups at each time point. 6. Legend positioning: Legends are positioned identically in both images with same color coding. 7. Grid patterns: Both images have identical background grid patterns. 8. Confidence intervals: The shaded confidence interval bands around each curve appear identical. 9. Program information: Bottom text shows different timestamps - first image shows [2025-03-20 07:50:28.240308] while second shows [2024-04-18 20:17:28]. 10. The horizontal dashed line at 0.5 probability is present and identical in both images."

[1] "The images are nearly identical ANCOVA analysis tables with the following minor differences: 1) Image positioning - the table appears slightly lower/more centered in the second image compared to the first, 2) Image quality/resolution - there are very subtle differences in text clarity and border line thickness, likely due to different scanning or compression settings, 3) Background shading - minimal variations in the white background tone between the two images. All numerical values, text content, table structure, headers, and statistical data are identical between both images."

```

[1] "After carefully examining both images, I found these to be identical financial documents showing Primary Endpoint Stage 1+2 Progression-free survival analysis data. Both images contain the same table structure, identical numerical values, headers, formatting, and footnotes. All statistical data including N values, percentages, confidence intervals, and p-values are exactly the same. The document layout, spacing, fonts, and overall presentation are identical. No differences were detected between the two images."
