# Overview

The objectives of the **R Consortium R Submission Pilot 5** Project are:  

1. Deliver a **publicly accessible** R-based Submission through the [eCTD portal](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/electronic-regulatory-submission-and-review/electronic-common-technical-document-ectd) using datasetjson.
1. Expand on the work done in [Submission Pilot 1 and Pilot 3](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-pilot1/), by now utilizing R to generate ADaM datasets.
