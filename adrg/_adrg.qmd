# Introduction

## Purpose

This document provides context for the analysis datasets and terminology that benefit from additional explanation beyond the Data Definition document (define.xml). In addition, this document provides a summary of ADaM conformance findings. @sec-a1 provides detailed procedures for installing and configuring a local R environment.

## Source Data Used for Analysis Dataset Creation

The ADaM datasets were derived from SDTM version 1.2. For traceability, the SDTM is publicly available at the [PHUSE Github Repository](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project/tree/master/updated-pilot-submission-package/900172/m5/datasets/cdiscpilot01/tabulations/sdtm).

Which can be traced back to the original [CDISC SDTM & ADaM Pilot Project](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project).

# Protocol Description

## Protocol Number and Title

-   **Protocol Number:** CDISCPilot1
-   **Protocol Title:** Safety and Efficacy of the Xanomeline Transdermal Therapeutic System (TTS) in Patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer’s Disease

The reference documents can be found [here](https://github.com/cdisc-org/sdtm-adam-pilot-project/blob/master/updated-pilot-submission-package/900172/m5/53-clin-stud-rep/535-rep-effic-safety-stud/5351-stud-rep-contr/cdiscpilot01/cdiscpilot01.pdf).

## Protocol Design in Relation to ADaM Concepts

### Objectives:

The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of transdermal xanomeline, 50cm^2^ and 75cm^2^, and placebo in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.

### Methodology:

This was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. Subjects were randomized equally to placebo, xanomeline low dose, or xanomeline high dose. Subjects applied 2 patches daily and were followed for a total of 26 weeks.

### Number of Subjects Planned:

300 subjects total (100 subjects in each of 3 groups)

## Treatment Variables

ARM versus TRT01P

```         
  Are the values of ARM equivalent in meaning to values of TRT01P?

    Yes.
```

ACTARM versus TRT01A

```         
  If TRT01A is used, then are the values of ACTARM equivalent to values of TRT01A?

    Not applicable - ACTARM is not used.
```

Use of ADaM Treatment Variables in Analysis

```         
  Are both planned and actual treatment variables used in analysis?

    Yes. Planned treatment variables are used for study population and efficacy 
    analyses, whilst actual treatment variables are used for the safety analysis.
    All subjects received the treatment arm to which they were randomised and so
    the planned treatment is equivalent to the actual treatment for all subjects.
```

Use of ADaM Treatment Grouping Variables in Analysis

```         
  Are both planned and actual treatment grouping variables used in analysis?

    Not applicable - treatment grouping variables are not used.
```

## Use of Visit Windowing, Unscheduled Visits, and Record Selection

Was windowing used in one or more analysis datasets?

```         
  Yes
```

Were unscheduled visits used in any analyses?

```         
  Yes
```

## Imputation/Derivation Methods

For ASTDT in ADAE, this date was converted to numeric SAS date from AE.AESTDTC. If the day component is missing, a value of '01' is used. If both the month and day are missing no imputation is performed. See define.xml.

### ADSL - Subject-Level Analysis Dataset

The subject level analysis dataset (ADSL) contains required variables for demographics, treatment groups, and population flags. In addition, it contains other baseline characteristics that were used in both safety and efficacy analyses. All patients in DM were included in ADSL. The following are the key population flags are used in analyses for patients:

-   SAFFL – Safety Population Flag (all patients having received any study treatment)

-   ITTFL – Intent-to-Treat Population Flag (all randomized patients)

### ADADAS - ADAS-COG Analysis Dataset

ADADAS contains analysis data from the ADAS-Cog questionnaire, one of the primary efficacy endpoints. It contains one record per subject per parameter (ADAS-Cog questionnaire item) per VISIT. Visits are placed into analysis visits (represented by AVISIT and AVISITN) based on the date of the visit and the visit windows.

### ADAE - Adverse Events Analysis Dataset

ADAE contains one record per reported event per subject. Subjects who did not report any Adverse Events are not represented in this dataset. The data reference for ADAE is the SDTM AE (Adverse Events) domain and there is a 1-1 correspondence between records in the source and this analysis dataset. These records can be linked uniquely by STUDYID, USUBJID, and AESEQ. Events of particular interest (dermatologic) are captured in the customized query variable (CQ01NAM) in this dataset. Since ADAE is a source for ADTTE, the first chronological occurrence based on the start dates (and sequence numbers) of the treatment emergent dermatological events are flagged (AOCC01FL) to facilitate traceability between these two analysis datasets.

### ADLBC - Analysis Dataset Lab Blood Chemistry

ADLBC contains one record per lab analysis parameter, per time point, per subject. ADLBC contains lab chemistry parameters and these data are derived from the SDTM LB (Laboratory Tests) domain. Two sets of lab parameters exist in ADLBC. One set contains the standardised lab value from the LB domain and the second set contains change from previous visit relative to normal range values. In some of the summaries the derived end-of-treatment visit (AVISITN=99) is also presented.

### ADTTE - AE Time To 1st Derm. Event Analysis

ADTTE contains one observation per parameter per subject. ADTTE is specifically for safety analyses of the time to the first dermatologic adverse event. Dermatologic AEs are considered an adverse event of special interest. The key parameter used for the analysis of time to the first dermatological event is with PARAMCD of "TTDE".

## QC Findings and Common Issues

In this Pilot 3 study, our focus was to create a subset of ADaMs based on the CDSICPILOT data, using R. We compared our R generated ADaMs against the CDISCPILOT ADaMs, created in SAS, as a QC step. With these comparisons we listed the QC Findings with explanations as to why these findings exist. We also came across common issues throughout the ADaM generation process, which could be helpful for improvements utilising the CDISC Pilot data in the future. More details can be found in the appendix (Appendix 2 and Appendix 3).

# Submission of Programs
